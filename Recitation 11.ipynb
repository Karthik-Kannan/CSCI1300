    "Let's start with something we already know about- Arrays. To recap, an array is a contiguous series that holds a fixed number of values of the same datatype. We know how to use indices to access and manipulate arrays. A **vector** is a *template class* that uses all of the syntax that we used with vanilla arrays, but adds in functionality that relieves of the burden of keeping track of memory allocation for the arrays. It also introduces a bunch of other features that makes handling arrays much simpler."
